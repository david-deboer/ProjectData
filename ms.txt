value: 2/28/18
owner: BL
commentary: M82’s starburst has a compressed “microwave window” suggesting a relatively narrow frequency range to look for ETI signals.  In addition, M82’s star-formation rate makes it a good place to look for rapid transients, something never done before to my knowledge but possible with GBT.
